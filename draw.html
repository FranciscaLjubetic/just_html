                <h1>To Draw</h1>
                <p>I can't say I like to draw, because it's <em> my habit</em> since I was child. <br>
                    I don't draw so much, because I currently don't have time to do it. <br>
                    But for me <strong> is the main way to communicate. </strong><br>
                    I'm developer, I'm compelled to work step by step in a discursive manner. <br>
                    <s>But I know, <em>and you know</em>, and <del> everyone knows</del> that the world does not happen <br>
                    in a discursive manner, never. </s>Maybe the world is nearer to be an instant set <br>
                    of blurs or nets or threads, but <sub> just like images and drawings</sub>. <br>
                    I'm a <sup> messy human</sup> and my emotional way of facing world, due <br>
                    to my childhood (I have no idea why, to be sincere), <del> will always be</del><br>
                    "everything at the same time", so I draw to clarify the maps I need.</p>
